Nor was there enough to convince the four-year-old to take custody of the umbrella for later. The dampness made it chilly outside the clothes and hot inside them. The early rain landed so softly that the puddles on the bare grainy dirt of the tree planters were clear water, like a spring filtered up through sand. A little more than an hour later, it was falling hard enough to stream from the scaffold. It was streaming from the canopy over the subway mouth on Union Square, too. Just beyond that, a dangling little radio played the news under the shelter of the array of the fivedollaUMbrella man. The spray was blowing too hard for five dollars to have much hope of making a difference. Then it blew even harder. The afternoon dried out but got no more inviting, and in the middle of rush hour a faint drizzle returned. It took effort, under the pall, to see that all around was bright green.",1

The fog lightened still more, to a spectral unclearness on the air. The sky went from gray to white, and people intermittently cast shapeless shadows on the gum-flecked pavement.

Only the shimmer and flicker of construction lamps in a building far, far downtown betrayed anything less than perfect clarity.",4

On the luxury building’s roof deck, the drifts were up to the controls on the gas grills. The lobby was full of bundled-up children coming and going. The four-year-old reached the sidewalk and immediately began climbing and pummeling the snowbanks, all other purpose forgotten. The snowpack on the curved glass roof of the Apple Store was dripping menacingly. On Broadway the first slush was already in the gutters. The trains were running far apart. There was a smell like wood smoke, a nice familiar after-blizzard smell, but in the Times Square station. Out the train windows, underground, there was snow: a medium-sized snowstorm’s worth of accumulation had found its way through the grates onto the 23rd Street platform; here and there snow traced the cables running along the tunnels. Huge wedges of snow reared atop the cars in Brooklyn. The four-year-old resumed his attack on the banks. A man passed wearing woolens, carrying wooden cross-country skis. A crew of entrepreneurs with shovels was digging out people’s vehicles from their parking spaces. Cars already liberated threw loose slush at pedestrians, and a truck strafed the sidewalk with salt. Steam rose from an egg-and-bacon bagel sandwich as young mouths nibbled at it on the go. Every visible contour of Prospect Park was being sledded on. The children found a pair of suitable runs and began saucering down them, while grown adults claimed the next run over. Eventually the adults fractured their last plastic disc with their weight and departed, their abandoned path glinting like a luge run. The children clustered their saucers and went down in a bumping mass. They heaved snowballs at one another. More adults arrived, sliding on a flattened Amazon carton and a partial saucer scavenged from the trash, the saucer fragment gliding and turning till it the broken edge caught and stranded the rider. A snowboarder hit the little slope, indifferent to where anyone else had been or aimed to go. The sun found a sheet of cloud and dimness fell so that the troughs of the saucer-tracks became invisible. A chill settled into the fingertips inside their gloves. The children retired from sliding and focused entirely on snowballs, keeping it up most of the way back from the park. The only complaint about their wet socks came when it was time to slip the boots back on, after hot chocolate, and their heels got stuck going in.",5

In the other bedroom, the buffeting of the wind rose above the roar of the heater. The clouds lost their smoothness and plainness, becoming ruffled and tinted in lilac and gold. A knuckle had scraped open and was bleeding a little. Outside the withered leaves on the oaks were hissing. The waxing moon was finely detailed in a sky only slightly less than day-blue.

The warmth was enchanting, enchanting as a house made of cake and sugar in the forest, enchanting as a palace filled with luxuries with one locked upper room. A double-decker tour bus rolled by, its entire side covered by an ad for the Times Square branch of a tropical party bar chain. The haze was a cataract over the view down Broadway.

People were bundled up more than was necessary; the marathon blankets seemed mostly ceremonial. There was not much wind in the streets, but the clouds were hurrying overhead.

In the middle of the morning, light came through as if it meant to, but then went away again. The clouds were the same color as before but their aspect was changed, lumpier. Then they broke up into an afternoon hodgepodge, clouds of all shades and kinds, high and low, little ivory cumulus puffs in the distance and big dark ones nearer at hand. There was even some sun — enough to flood the landscape along Broadway before dinner, to brighten Columbus Circle and Lincoln Center and the Ansonia, and to shine on the white bricks of the little veterinary hospital on the cross street. Bright pure silver-white stood above pink shreds, and then the silver went pink, a full florid sundown routine. The chill on the night air, on the way to get tissues and medicine, was the only thing that made the sinuses feel any better.",3

The breeze stayed cool after midday; out in the warmth of the sun on Broadway, the gusts were stronger, and soon high clouds helped thin the light. The wind on the avenue was not too much for the balloon on the walk to and from the pre-K pickup. The four-year-old declined to wear the jacket he’d been brought.

Outside was clement and cool; the foliage tossed a little but no rain came. The grass or the things growing where the grass used to be made a dry field for wiffleball, sharp grounders bouncing irregularly uphill. A molting blue jay, more mangy gray than blue on top, flew to and from a feeder. Sun came on, and the low, soft plants in the deer-mowed understory of the woods glowed a vivid tennis-ball color. Along the highway, nature’s last greens had begun to burn to back to gold, with flares of incipient red showing now and then. Goldenrod burnished the shoulder. Horses in a field switched their tails. The light was painterly, in an austere photorealist manner. Some cornfields had gone over to a caramel color and others had gone the color of withered corn. Off the Turnpike in Elizabeth, fluffy globes of grasses in various earth tones clung like tribbles to an eroding dirt mound. A man and boy played catch with a football in the empty stretch of parking lot between the Ikea cars and the Toys R Us cars. The low planes seemed even more impossible than usual.

The side plaza at Lincoln Center smelled of swimming pool: a note of chlorine, a note of cocoa butter. Jet planes crossed the sky at right angles, leaving no trails. Pigeons, near immobile and loaflike, occupied the green of the chained-off grass roof.

The breeze gathered strength as it came up Broadway. Sweaters were out, and sport coats. Instead of last week’s hot exhalations, the subway stairs breathed in cool air. A police officer was out below the Flatiron directing traffic contrary to the signals, and then came more police and police cars, and a surveying tripod right out in Fifth Avenue, and a barrier drape, parallel to the lane markings, that did not conceal the red of a pool of blood. A block beyond, the gorgeous day went about its business. Blinding white flared into the office off the shades and blinds half-lowered on the windows of other offices, across the street. The wind flipped the cover of a paperback of Six Centuries of Great Poetry lying on the pavement by an overflowing trash can. The breeze was cool but warm, some inverse of feverishness; the buildings separated themselves from the sky like thick lines of paint coming off the brush.

Full wakefulness was required to establish for certain that it was outside. The day to which eyes reopened hours later was clear and sharply detailed: lampshades in apartments across the avenue, balconies off in New Jersey, aircraft over the Hudson. A small plane banked and turned, showing the white of its wings. There was a cool, lively breeze to match the light. Down at far west 34th Street there were white peppercorns of clouds through the new glass canopy over the new escalators up from the deep new 7 train station. Immediately to the west, the clouds formed a blinding sheet that made it hard to look at all the cranes. The eight-year-old struggled to unfold and read the revised transit map in the wind. Happy people wandered around taking pictures. No transit or development improvements had made up for how sneeze-inducingly sun-blasted the open concrete of Eleventh Avenue was. In the time it took to walk from the new subway stop to the old elevated rails of the High Line, the clouds had begun to predominate. The seed heads and bright purple flowers shook in the gusts through their replicated accidental meadow-space. Reflected clouds filled the available panels in an unfinished glass wall. Enough sun came back for the return trip that the cooled air of the subway was a palpable minor relief. Later, uptown, the picturesque variety of whites and grays suddenly flattened into a single shade and rain came rattling down. Within the hour the clouds had pulled apart again to resume their dramatic contrast and motion. A small but color-soaked sunset showed in a gap between buildings, and then the sky was all iron and silver and steel.

It took a sudden wash of sun, and the project of looking for rainbows, to pry the slumbrous three-year-old out of his bunk. The air outside had cooled off but was still uncomfortable and thick. The rain started again and stopped again. A few fresh drops were on the pavement on the way to the elementary-school pickup. Before the class got out, the rain was coming down so hard it was necessary to retreat to the scaffold over the driveway. Water was dripping steadily from the roof of the far-right-hand elevator, the air conditioner overwhelmed by the sogginess.

Regardless of the dimness, though, it was already hot on the long new walk to the pre-K, and the walk cutting back to Columbus Circle. The sun had found its way out, and the climate control on the subway train failed to take off the resulting layer of sweat. Water cascaded from air conditioners to the sidewalks, the overladen air dropping its burden at the first opportunity. A localized darkness covered Fifth Avenue in the afternoon. A few raindrops appeared on lumber on top of a scaffold; an umbrella went up. Nothing conclusive happened. The air conditioning at home was shut off, in advance of the announced mosquito spraying. Just past lights out, a rubbery smell seeped into the stuffy bedroom, where the covers had been kicked away. It strengthened for a while, and then either faded out or became olfactory background. Later, dreams under a tangled sheet were interrupted by wet-tire sounds from the avenue, the presumed pesticide treatment presumably being washed off by the rain.",0

A FedEx truck pulled up to double-park outside the Apple Store, blocking the view of oncoming taxis on Broadway, so it took a sweaty sprint to catch up with an open one a block later. The three-year-old paused on 57th Street to admire the crisply lit cranes of Billionaires Row as they worked toward consuming the blue sky behind them. A man tripped over a pigeon and shook out his leg in disgust or surprise. Someone leaned unceasingly on the horn in the clogged traffic on Columbus Circle, with other horns adding individual short honks to the droning note of fixed rage. The subway stairs were an exhaling windpipe. By late day the air was moving a little, but heavily.

The shadows outside were still coolish but the sun was sharpening. There was dappled shade on the pitcher’s mound on the concrete playground diamond — at least, on the effective spot for pitching kiddie wiffleball — but any contact beyond a simple nubber led into a blazing, blinding wasteland. Still it was time to wring the last opportunity out of summer: scooter and bicycle and skateboard traffic looped erratically around the hardtop; soccer and basketballs rolled free; the wiffleball lineup expanded and contracted, but mostly expanded, as new players wandered in and out. More parents showed up to play defense. The cleanup hitter blasted a pitch high into the brightness and the grownup pitcher turned to take step in pursuit and stumbled over a kiddie bike cutting behind. There were dry leaves on the ground. The shade deepened and extended further across the infield. Outside the gates, children were operating a lemonade stand. The pitcher had skipped sunscreen on the legs and spent early afternoon warily checking the calves for any sign of a flush. Afternoon was even more thoroughly sun-blasted, so that every increment of the sun’s movement registered. The narrow, merciful band of shade under the scaffold on the way down to the market had been pushed aside on the walk back. The shadow behind the glass tower at Amsterdam had widened, but was quickly interrupted by the reflection off the other glass tower, down and across the avenue, casting trembling line segments of light through the locust leaves. Sweat stung the newly shaven upper lip. After dinner and sunset, outdoors still presented a wall of heat. The three-year-old had insisted on flip-flops, and went sprinting up the block in them.

Again the foulness was more telling than the heat. The new exhaust from idling traffic blended with the general filth of the atmosphere. A thick canopy of trumpet vine, surging south, shaded a bench on the Broadway median. The children survived a detour to the grocery store without wilting or even whining. The late-day air was still thick, but not as saturated as real high summer — heavy, rather than sweaty. Unfamiliar kids drifted into and out of and back into the playground wiffleball session, fusing for a spell with someone else’s netless volleyball lesson in short left field. The wiffleball was one adult against two or four or three children, each baserunner circling the bases without stopping till chased all the way around to home plate. It took four cans of seltzer to rehydrate the pitcher afterward, in the darkness of late dinnertime. Out in the night, partygoers milled in the lights by the grills on the new luxury building’s roof, fading into a shapeless mass of bodies where the light gave out — more bodies, surely, than yet had moved into the stacked glass-fronted boxes below.

The heat of the heat wave was present but somehow abstract; what registered instead was the dirtiness of the air. Only down in the subway did things truly swelter; the eight-year-old voted to hop into the air conditioning of a local train rather than waiting on the platform for an express.

Tiny flashbulbs went off in the sidewalk concrete. Past midday, clouds covered and uncovered the zenith. The thick warmth soaked into chilled joints. The later-day sky was clear again, admitting new heat. Cops and banjos flanked the subway entrance. The entrance hallway in the big public school was sweltering, but air conditioners made a racket in the old, hard-surfaced auditorium, under the dim blue of the lights.

An immense running figure, in cirrus brushstrokes, stood in midstride over the west. The three-year-old’s newer and brighter light-up shoes went strobing down the deepening shadows under a scaffold, meeting the flash of a woman’s burnished gold sandals coming the other way. It was sweaty still in the gathering dusk. A man carried a stack of glowing artificial votive candles around the edge of the pierside cafe, setting them out one by one on the outdoor tables. The George Washington Bridge twinkled. Dark wavelets flickered on the pink field of the river. A slow fishy breeze cooled the pier a little.

Summer clothes were a matter of welcoming the breeze, not escaping the heat. “Oh, my gosh,” the eight-year-old said, “that cloud is so bright white.” An unnecessary downblast from an air conditioner hit the top of the steps where people were following the cookie smell, one stair at a time, down into the bakery. In the afternoon, out the window, clouds darkened and began to close together. Then, having issued the warning against taking the day for granted, they relented and separated again. The three-year-old argued that it was chilly enough for his Batman costume to be practical for the playground. Some note of solvent on the breeze brought back model paints in Philadelphia summers three and a half decades before. “Super Bad” played out the window of something in traffic, most likely a clean white Land Rover.

A little squad of clouds cut off the direct sun briefly and then departed. More came in after, their contours dramatic but unreal through the blur of haze, the light around them tinted oddly. Out in the thick heat, an SUV sat at the curb with its windows down, blasting music too loudly for its speakers as the driver bustled around doing something outside it. A pigeon waded into a puddle up to the feathered part of its legs, bent its head, and drank. Some of the clouds, moving overhead in the afternoon, looked capable of rain. The blacktop by the Tavern on the Green was intolerable, making escape to the Park momentarily worse before it got better. A saxophonist played what was, on attentive listening, “Call Me,” with a 30-foot radius around him empty of anyone not in the process of going by. Two kids whirred along on free-range go-karts, checkered pennants flying from the rear. The doubled shade of the clouds and trees had an effect; a cool breeze rolled along the dusty ground. A little burst of raindrops fell. Later, another little spray would streak the apartment windows, followed by returning sun and a confused blue mist on the river. The air in the Times Square subway station was so hot it hurt the eyes. As the N train rose up into Queens, the sun was finding thickness in the battered markings on roadway ramps. Light traced a swayed roofline nearby and the top edge of a cloud mass high over Manhattan.

Up on the new, high office roof — the view easily spanning from the Hudson to the East River and the abundance of of water towers in between — the sun was strong, the parapet hot to the touch. Plants stirred in some rooftop gardens and stood still in others. The street shade deepened while the higher floors of buildings still shone. A family of three generations swayed and sang along with a street trumpeter playing “When the Saints Go Marching In” on his silver horn. In the tranquil night, the smell of growing things entered the cab window on the approach to the Park. The sky was discolored by haze and light but cloudless now.

Breeze gently flipped the ends of the flags of the United States and H & M. The only flaw with the plan to skip the subway and walk twenty-two blocks was an immense and sticky dog turd at the 23rd Street crossing. Nine, ten years ago this had been the regular walk, Flatiron to Penn Station. The blocks of wholesale goods, with mango vendors on the sidewalk, were hotter than everywhere else.

People came down the stairs utterly drenched, clothes saturated and drooping. After a few minutes, the cataract seemed to have subsided to a mere downpour, enough to tempt escape. But if what was falling had diminished at all, it was fully offset by the swirling waters underfoot. Two blocks was enough to flood the shoes, while a renewed deluge soaked through the shirt and left hair wet to the scalp.

Hours later, in the full sun, the asphalt patching on the edge of the half-rebuilt roadway of Amsterdam Avenue was oozing tar. In the Park, the grass was dry enough to sit on to eat lunch, or to snub a sandwich and eat pastries. Garbage waiting at a collection point spread noisome fumes over the pathway. The children set off to try to find a playground and abandoned the search in favor of climbing rocks, scrambling up and down in the dappled and bearable shade.

A robin with its breast not fully reddened flushed from beside a puddle and launched itself across the park roadway, inches from the bumper fairing of a passing taxi. The narrow vertical sets among the Time Warner Center windows captured details of the clouds in triplicate. Crushed and twisted umbrella wreckage, completely dry, lay in a crosswalk. A woman in the subway entrance was talking loudly and with fervor about Jesus. The coolness held downtown. Up on the roof, a fly lay drowned atop a bowl of salsa dregs and rainwater. In the late-day streets were light and birdsong and the clink of cutlery. Now the clouds were single and widely spaced. Everywhere were paper shopping bags, brand-labeled and open-topped in the air, the people stimulated to commerce.

In the bath, the three-year-old recounted how a butterfly had landed on his brother’s head when they were on the grass roof. Cross-checking the story revealed that the head was the shoulder, but the butterfly was an accurately described red admiral. The conjunction of Venus and Jupiter shone in the darkening west.

Mushrooms had sprouted in all the forks of one elm’s roots, while the next elm over stood mushroom-free. Downtown the morning light was chalky. By afternoon, the clouds were a thin sheet, making the roof a pleasant refuge from the air conditioning. A medium-gray cloud blanket was draped low down in the north, over the Empire State Building, but it didn’t amount to a threat. The real clouds came in over rush hour, and with them — a raindrop, or an air conditioner drip? A rumble of thunder, or a taxi revving? Then raindrops came for sure, and a gust and a flash, and certain thunder. But the B train outran or outmaneuvered the onslaught. The radar map on the phone showed something slashing through Brooklyn and away, but the people coming into the Columbus Circle station were still dry, the streets above still breezeless. One of the new New Beetles sat in a crosswalk with rain beaded on it, carried in from somewhere else. Finally a little rain fell, but only a little. Odd bright patches appeared in the west, even as a giant dark zeppelin-belly of cloud cruised by, flying uptown, gondola-shape dangling from it. A burning gold light found an opening in the clouds and came through strongly enough to cast a shadow on the wardrobe door on the far side of the room. Then came not just an intimation of the sun but the sun itself, framed above the next apartment in a gap maybe four times its width and twice its height. Out through the gap poured not only golds but restored blues and even whites. One long black spike of cloud still drifted in front of it, and after that passed, a little sprig of black followed. But the golden light was flooding everything, flocked with white and tinged purple. What had been the clear blue parts abruptly became textured, rippling gold too. Soft little olive clouds floated under the display, as the gold became orange, then red, then purple. Down low in New Jersey was a smooth milky purple, spreading like paint in paint thinner. The sky was blood, wine, tangerine peels, green glass. It was so far beyond the powers of a camera that the only thing to do was to shoot it in black and white.",5

An evaporative breeze crossed the top of Columbus Circle, meeting the light sweat from the walk out of the Park. The heat was firm but bearable, with clouds interrupting the sun before it could build to its worst. Grand Street was uncrowded. The afternoon glare caught the grime on the apartment windows.

At the piano lesson, one curtain bellied against the screen and one leaf of a potted plant stirred, but no current made it as far as the couch. Toward dinnertime, dark clouds with ragged edges moved under the high white ones. A seagull, its own study in gray and white, banked and turned. A few raindrops tapped on the window. Upriver the view was clear to the faraway highlands, while 120 degrees away downriver was an opaque gray blur, the water invisible. The gray thinned and a boat appeared between buildings, trailing a white wake. By the time dinner was over, the sky was clear blue, the air calm. The Lincoln Center did its boom-thump skyward. A little girl and her littler sister, in dresses and cardigans, sat on the fountains rim, the older one making conducting or summoning gestures at the waters, then whooping and tipping back her head at a high-flaring eruption. The three-year-old ran himself sweaty, then ran some more, furious that his older brother’s longer stride could go faster. The final traces of the sun edged the clouds in the west with vivid pink.

But those ambitions from the brightness of midday met a late sky full of clouds. The sound of a passing plane rebounded off the low ceiling. Horse droppings lay in the splash marks of their attendant juices in the entry to the park. Balloons lunged and leaned against the barriers separating the general public from the VIP section. A raindrop or two fell. The balloons were liberated into the darkening sky, which got darker still as the introductory remarks and thanks to benefactors dragged on. Real rain began pattering down. Umbrellas and tarps came out, and a smell of wet grass and wet people thickened and clung to everything. The conductor apologized and vamped for a while as the string players struggled to protect their instruments from the oncoming elements. The three-year-old had brought his swim trunks and wanted to change into them. The stage and the program were hastily rearranged — Copland dismissed, the strings pushed further back from the stage.

After it abated, umbrellas were still out — and a yellow poncho. One person held a plastic bookstore bag overhead. The air mashed down on the ambient smells, concentrating them. Uptown the subway steps led to a view of unanticipated white and blue. Secondhand sunbeams bounced around Broadway as cab tires slished on the wet roadway. Now the buildings stood distinct, in air washed clean. Gold poured along 60th Street and spotlit leaves here and there in the corner of the Park. Little clouds, a rich apricot color, blew fast and low in front of a wide-spreading silver-blue contrail. Light pierced Avery Fisher Hall.

Little puddles lay in the flagstones outside the back door, and the share car sparkled, free of road dust. A glossy blackbird rummaged in the platform full of sunflower seeds. Up above the trees the sun was coming and going. Gray squirrels flowed long-bodied over the shady ground. Somewhere on the steamy air was the smell of a skunk, almost certainly from a skunk. The old dog acquired new briskness in her hobbling step at the prospect of a walk. Volley after volley of frogs launched themselves plopping into the water of the drainage ditch. The dog tottered on the tilting edge of the roadway and slipped onto the weedy embankment and thence, rolling, down into the mud. Fished out and set upright, she continued on her way. Further on in the roadway lay a baked flattened mosaic that had once been a box turtle. Later in the afternoon, a boom of thunder carried into the kitchen.

A softer growl of thunder came, and then a long rippling one, sustained and sustained even longer. Every leaf was still. When the rain came it came straight down. What the storm lacked in winds it made up in gravitational violence, big drops pounding the trees and the ground. Water poured over the edge of the clogproof gutters, leaving a soaking line across the back of a shirt in the time it took to reach out and boost the dog back into the house. A brown stream was running down the back yard, between the dog fence and the edge of the garden. In the upper reaches, behind the garage, there were foaming rapids. The rain subsided into tree drip, but water poured along the roadside. A deer stood in a field in the returning sun. Out on the interstate, light bouncing off the flooded grooves of the rumble strip flickered on the ceiling of the car. The highway passed in and out of lighter showers. Traffic thinned and thickened; men in expensive cars drove angrily up the bottom of the Turnpike. Rain smeared the windshield in a jam by Newark Airport.

For one inviting, decisive moment, it looked as if there were sun on the steps up out of the Columbus Circle station, but whatever had created that impression was gone in the time it took to get through the turnstile.

A woman in shorts cut shorter than her buttocks walked a pit bull out the side door of the hotel and over to an aging red Pontiac. A mockingbird perched on a caution sign while some other bird sang out of view. A light rain was falling on the walk across the wide, curving pedestrian-unfriendly street from the Denny’s to the funeral parlor. In the middle of the service a blast of thunder shook the anodyne chapel space, the way no stone or brick church would shake. A downpour was strafing the parking lot after, pelting the limousine all the way to the cemetery, battering the Garden of Faith and the Garden of Serenity. Water poured out of a pipe, flooded the gutters. Rain drenched the black suits and black hats and black raincoats of the funeral-home staff as they labored up the steps with the casket. Inside the door of the mausoleum, cemetery staff warned about marble floors. Rain beaded on the casket. The officiant had audibly sprinkled it with holy water back at the chapel; he sprinkled it once more. The rain abated to a mere shower, then stopped. In a corner of a parking lot behind an abandoned Pier 1 store, the suit went back into the suitcase, suit and case both only slightly wet from flopping around the open hatch of the rental car. More clouds were coming, navy blue and smoke gray rolling up in appalling bulk behind a crow perched on a Popeye’s sign. Then new rain crashed down on the trellises outside the Olive Garden. The clouds swelled like risen dough, lumpy and dimpled where someone had started poking it down. On the narrow two-lane back road Google Maps was choosing to get to the airport, the right-hand lane was flooded all the way to the yellow line. The rental-car return workers were wearing slickers and storm pants in safety green. They suggested sheltering in the car till a ride to the terminal could be arranged. A housefly was sheltering there too. The gate clerk wouldn’t even talk about the Philadelphia flight, with the previous flight’s passengers still backed up at his desk. It rained. It stopped. Who cared. The plane was located, after some time, and boarded, after some more. A little brightness came through and shone in the sheeted water by the baggage handlers’ feet. The clouds seen from above were a loose weave, clumping and pulling apart. It took minutes to remember the specific old bedspread, 20 years ago, whose synthetic batting had clumped and pulled exactly that way. A pale blankness filled the window till the eyes lost focus and little hot white bursts of sparks bloomed on the retinas. It was still blank out, darker blank, when the wheels clunked into position to descend into Philadelphia. The rain falling there was different because it was much colder. The suitcase handle was wet when it arrived on the jetway. Dark clouds hastened the fall of night, the sun’s departure time as notional and unknowable as an airplane’s. Was it raining now? Was it not? At no particular time, the next plane was airborne, its lights strobing fuzzily on the clouds. The puddles of Newark were still, undisturbed by falling drops. The city air, up out of the subway, was clean and cool and rainless, though the gutters were too full for a roller bag and as the eye looked ahead to those gutters, the shoe soles skidded on the wet metal of the subway grate. A gust of wind threw down a splash of drops from a tree, where they’d been held in reserve for a passerby who might have missed out on the rain.",1

After delays in the dark of Penn Station, the train emerged into blue mid-morning twilight in New Jersey. Male blackbirds perched on the reeds, darker little dashes on the gloomy background. The phone rang with a robot calling to announce that the plane would leaving 50 minutes late. Egrets stood almost up to their white bellies in the water. There was water on empty lots, creeping into a turn lane, ponding along the rail beds. Down below the AirTrain, the lower branches of trees were submerged. The first glimpse of gray dull-shining tarmac looked like an estuary. Flash-flood warning tones blared from one phone after another in the men’s room. Rain streaked the glass of the restaurant as two women hailed a third to join them for late-morning mimosas. An old bald man in a gray suit, wearing a Princeton necktie and carrying a straw hat with a Princeton hatband, asked to have a cold bottle of beer. The rain hit the windows harder. The extra 50 minutes passed, and another 25 or 30 minutes. The plane finally appeared; one load of passengers was exchanged for another. The rain stopped. The plane sat. There would be a 15-minute wait. An hour and a half into the 15 minutes — as the phone’s browser announced that the connecting flight from Philadelphia was already wheels-up and gone — the plane finally got cleared into its ration of sky, hitting the clouds almost immediately. It climbed to the top of the lowest layer of clouds, but only barely. In almost no time it came back down through them, disclosing a graveyard and then rowhouses through bright mist. A pleasant breeze rode up the jetway as the gatechecked luggage slowly arrived. There was another plane, already at its gate; only its crew, gone wayward in the rain-tattered system, could not be accounted for. The sky darkened. At last they were found, the plane sent out. Not far from the runway, the pilot got on the speaker with a regretful announcement about thunderstorms along the way and a wait for “route approval” and the fact that he was killing the engines for a while. Then he turned them back on, and the plane went up for a quick glimpse of a smoldering refinery before hitting the clouds again, clouds upon clouds, on up through to a view of tumbled mountains and pillars of them, ivory and gray against blue, with ever more spaces between them. The land appeared in patches and then expanses. One flat gray cloud, moving alone, trailed a curtain of rain from its leading edge. Then there were no clouds but a few high ones, and haze over fields all the way to the barrier islands and the ocean. Whitecaps appeared and dissolved in the dark green water. The concrete of the runway twinkled in the sun. A pine thrust up against clear blue sky. The day here had by all accounts been a hot one, but it was cooling off. The sneakers were swapped out for dress shoes in the parking lot, the sport coat shrugged into. In the cold of the funeral parlor there was no weather at all.",1

The stillness was good to be out in, inert on a padded roof chair, the buildings blue-faded versions of themselves. The scattered blue was so intense that the shadows on red chairs were purple. The mobile phone was almost too dim to read and almost too hot to hold, and both facts seemed worth attending to. Another commute under menacing skies led to a view of a peaceable blue-and-white-streaked west and to a wavering shadow on the kitchen wall where full sun passed through the heat of a burner.

The cross street was pungent like feces newly stepped on. Even the fresh cooking odors being generated by a food cart had a note of rot. The gray in the sky burned away to a thin whiteness over blue. The light was lovely and the air was cool and there was a smell by the gutter that was nauseating after perhaps one glass too many, or too hasty, of iced coffee. People were gladly sunstruck, invigorated by it, trying out their body parts. The platinum bleach jobs going around were brilliant. The barber could not stop sneezing till the shampooist ran out and brought back an over-the-counter pill and a cup of water. The windowshades had been opaque from outside the shop but from the chair, the street was visible, with only the details of the sidewalk stains fuzzed out. The temperature was neither warm nor cool enough to call attention to the absent hair. At the workday’s end there was a purposeful wind, and then uptown a big, light gray cloud stood over Broadway. The apartment lobby was suddenly dark, and the living room window showed heavy clouds over the river. A figure like a giant dangling torso with clawed hands dangled by its waist from the bottom of the main cloud, arched its back, and broke apart. Then the turmoil was replaced by a smooth and featureless gradient of light and color: “I think it’s a mixed-up color,” the three-year-old said. “I think it’s brownish orange.” “Blue to purple to orange,” the seven-year-old said. The orange fraction, glowing at the bottom, brightened and grew. The clouds acquired texture and turned lavender, then pink.

The cold didn’t sear exposed skin but sank through it into the depths of the finger joints. Two of the very few children on the playground raised a grim chiming sound by hammering at the square pipes of the climber with rocks of ice.

More icicles hung from the scaffold crosspipes, and ice weight bent the bamboo by 66th Street all the way to the sidewalk. The drizzle became a soaking mist; the mist became a pattering rain. A snowblower threw up a grubby plume, the new and old mingled together in a shade that could only still be called white by virtue of its failure to have settled on any other color. The gutters were full of slush floating on the waters held back by slush dams. Stroller wheels pushed through hard slush packed on the sidewalk.

Was this snow the things people had said about the storm or done around the storm? Or was it merely new and substantial and clean? The three-year-old went out to play with a friend and came back scarlet-cheeked, eating snow from the back of a mitten, resigned to the loss of a Batman figure somewhere in the playground drifts. Most things have a disappointment in them. The noodles in the cold-case ramen package, picked up the day before in the panic line at the store, had sprouted mold. Out in the late afternoon someone walked along the bare wet sidewalk carrying cross-country skis and poles, heading for someplace where snow would be. A plastic toboggan and saucer were coming home from the other direction. A fat-bellied two-ball snowman with cups for features stood beside the bus shelter. The statues by the fountain wore little white hats of snow. Out the window now, one had to admit the snow lay prettily enough on the far side of the Hudson.

By the early emergency pickup time for preschool, though, the snow was blowing again. A fuel oil truck was preparing to make a delivery to the mirrored tower. Some of the sidewalks were still bare; some looked bare but were slick with slush. At West End, the snow went from swirling to shooting hard down the avenue. The supermarket behind the preschool was overrun, the line for the registers reaching all the way to where the line for the bakery counter would ordinarily be. By two in the afternoon, the snow was white smoke streaming by. The steps down from the forecourt were well mounded with snow when the older boy’s school let out. On the storm blew, now thinner, now thicker. Now thinner. What was it amounting to?

The cross streets were full of fluffy chunks of snow, each lump distinct in its shadows in the retained illumination. A shutdown warning on the subway speakers carried up the un-shoveled steps out of the empty station. The streets were pale and vacant but they were still the streets. Things held their usual shapes, with no real prodigies or perils yet in evidence. Surely it had snowed this hard before. Where the way had been recently swept clean, the prints of the soles of boots, with dragging heel marks behind, stood cleanly in the thin renewed accumulation. A wide circle had been cleared around the fountain in Lincoln Center Plaza, and the water was going, lit from below, sending up a mist to mingle with the flakes in the glow.

The two-year-old hopped down from his seat and tried out a volleyball stance. A cloud big enough to achieve grayness made things so dim, for the moment, that one of the street lights came on. Foreshortened from the edge, the Sheep Meadow was so full it was almost impossible to find a vertical or horizontal line of open green across it. On the next lawn over, a young man threw his leg over the backs of a young woman’s thighs and pressed his face into hers. The gray clouds held their majority, or at least a ruling coalition with the white. All day the balance kept shifting. The afternoon sky in the west out the windows looked as if the clouds were still keeping control, but outside, the east and the zenith revealed themselves to be wholly uncontested blue.",5

The forecast of showers — deferred so many days now — seemed plausible for the first time. The story-time room at the library, into which the children had stumbled, unwitting, was chilly with air conditioning but humid nonetheless. Conditions were more comfortable out in the slatted shade of the library garden, bordered by roses and planted with dark purple foliage. Toward midday, two age-thickened men contemplated their motorcycles. A gigantic insect, near hummingbird size, flew among the branches of a pine. Down at the shore, the air was perfect, the sun cut by clouds passing. The water too was ideal. Big swells dipped to reveal a white ship far off, then rose to obstruct the view of the ship, then rose even higher as the first obstruction passed and the trough descended. Gulls gathered just above the waves, clustering and stabbing at the water; pelicans flew by low. The whole surface was rimpled, the sides of the wavelets roughened by their own little disturbances. Off to the north, parallel lines of blurry gray stretched from inland out to sea, but the brightness remained nearby. Fine misty spray shone above the usual splashing. The ocean carried the body and absorbed the mind. One hundred fifty yards, nearly two hundred, slid away. The walk back to the beach chairs was so long it seemed as if some mistake must have been made. A sanderling, bone-white streaked with black, ran on the wetted sands. People had built sand castles and embankments, and the tide advanced on them. The two-year-old edged out onto the last of the dry sand, then agreed to try the foam. Minutes later he was dangling in the full frothing surf, suspended by his armpits, kicking and splashing in wild defiance of or identification with the rushing waters. He yelled at the sea, his shirt wet past the chest. Even the hike up the back of the beach, the usually hot and tedious expanse of sand, was comfortable. The sky grayed over, till sunset was nothing but a darkening. Wrens chattered with a harsh insectoid rattle at a cat in their shrubbery. The surf at dusk boomed like incipient thunderstorms. Deep in the night, the real thunder came, and white lightning.",5

The pockets of the second swim trunks harbored old sand and old cash, washed and dried at least a year before. The low-tide waves were not choppy or obviously threatening, but they came in heavy and variable; out past the sandy churning, amid the calmer swells, a bigger one would suddenly rear up at face-smacking height. The water tasted more bitter than usual. Hours later, despite a rinse off, sand grains were still turning up in the creases of the eyelids. A tan dust on the rental car’s windshield scattered the afternoon sun. The biggest tower of the playground climber cast the only useful patch of shade on the wood chips. An osprey passed overhead and into the blinding sunlight with a glimpse of what looked like a fish, silver and floppy, in its grasp. The grill smoked, and the shadows of the miscellaneous plants in the sand around it grew long.

Gradually things brightened; the deck dried out. Still there was little beach-bound foot traffic. The seven-year-old went out to blow bubbles in what was now sunshine, exhorting them to fly over the roof of the building closer to the ocean. The sea at high tide was the color of wine bottles and the color of cobalt, deep beautiful tones, and deliciously warm, and much too rough to try swimming in. Letting the breaking sandy foam rush past, waist high and above, was the least alarming way of savoring it. There was no chilly shock — it felt as if it were warmer than the air, though it couldn’t have been. The children dug in the sand and refused to go near the water. Bright white little shells emerged, their edges eroded away. At sundown the sky was crocheted with silver and purple, with the sun a big smear of wet gold paint in the west. Kites hung above the dunes, fluttering and seemingly secure there, till one plunged nose-first out of view. The breeze smelled salty.

Pine cones lay everywhere; the two-year-old had to be dissuaded from expanding his collection of them to three and beyond. The ocean was rougher than before, with chunks of seaweed in it and a bobbing lump of foam garbage, but out beyond the churn it was still soothing to float in. At the trolley stop in the afternoon, the sun experimented with severity, but was mollified by a cloud. A rabbit sprinted alongside the trolley for a few strides, then veered off. The trolley rolled past trim, modest houses, then past an unfinished ostentatious house. A cool breeze blew through the wooden interior. A hawk flapped by with one wing notched by a missing primary. Out on the boardwalk, the air moved in warm and cold layers, like the water. The two-year-old went on a stomping run, xylophonic footsteps advancing down the boards.

Out on the beach, the waves spread cool air as they broke. Now the water was the green of good olives, and where it broke it was the green that appears now in late-rmodel cars. The swells were gentle, though people still swarmed the water with their artificial floating planks, sub-surfboards, as if some excitement might happen. A wind roared over wet ears on the way back up onto the shore, and a gust uprooted the beach umbrella and flung it five or ten yards, where it hit a stranger from behind. Inland, crape myrtles were in bloom on the supermarket lot. Even on the barren asphalt, the heat was less than painful.

The trees tossed. Then rain streaked the balcony doors and the sun came out. People walked under umbrellas in the sunshine, casting umbrella-shadows on the wet pavement by the square. Then the sun and rain were gone again and it was chilly, surprisingly so. A sport jacket, pulled on at the last minute for appearance and in case of air conditioning, was an unseasonable necessity. In the middle of a panel discussion, inside a covered-over courtyard, rain lashed the roof so violently that faces peered upward at the sound. The noise moderated a bit and then surged back, again and again, like the first blast of a storm repeating. Water clattered down the galvanized drainpipes, now indoors and flanking the stage. It was a long time before it subsided. The chill was deeper than any European climate control; a couple of people wrapped their bodies in the blankets that had been left folded on the backs of the chairs. Outside, the rain was dripping. Walking in it was possible, looking warily at the sky, letting a scowl be one’s umbrella, affirming one’s basic consent to be rained on — this much, and no more, as if an admonitory look would warn off any escalation. Nevertheless it did escalate, gently, until the balconies stacked overhead began to provide noticeable islands of shelter. Finally it stopped again, and light from the west lavished attention on all the details that the builders had lavished their attention on. Bright things gleamed on the dark dome of the basilica.

A man stripped off his shirt and changed into a t-shirt as he walked down Lafayette, barely breaking stride. The countdown clock for the uptown 1 was making false claims, and when the train pulled in it was a lobster tank of compacted frustration and resentment. Impossible and not worth it.

Downtown, the tilt of the grid made itself apparent, as sun baked the downtown side of the crosstown streets. Again the cumulus clouds migrated into the midday sky. A big one overlaid the sun, and for a while it was not hot. When the sun did return, though, it was piercing. Breezes, not exactly cool, moved now and then.

A tiger swallowtail flapped and glided back and forth outside the second-floor windows. The goldfinches were the same strong yellow the early fireflies had been the evening before. A female hummingbird sipped at a plastic flower on the feeder, while the male perched on one bare curving stalk amid the swelling wave of trumpet vine. Now and again he flashed the red of his throat. Outdoors was damp, the air full of peeping and piping and trilling. Spiderwebs hung in even the broad gaps between the trees, clinging to the face and neck. The grass had surrendered; the lawn was moss, violets, clovers, plantain. Mock strawberry, mushrooms the color of varnished wood. The low growth trembled with the passing of daddy longlegs. In midafternoon, the sun came out, over the back roads leading around the first of the traffic jams on the interstate. Up out of Maryland the sky was crowded with cumulus, but with gaps of blue finding the car along the way. In Delaware, the heavens and the road were choked off together, dark gray above and hopeless dark red on the traffic-flow map. A sprinkle of rain fell on the unmoving cars. In the distance were torqued and rippling cloud shape. Squeezing finally out into New Jersey brought glimpses of blue again. The two-year-old exclaimed and pointed out the half-moon, high in the daytime. All up the Turnpike, at intervals, came flooding gorgeous light, clear on the trees and the blossoms and the parked waiting excavators. Newark Airport was submerged in an enchanted rosy glow, a fog made of light, the low-flying planes immense but phantasmal. A blue blur over Manhattan matched the pink mists to the west. Then the sun was down, the car on its way back to the parking lot, past cyclists and overspilling restaurant crowds in the lukewarm darkness.

By afternoon, the bricks were strewn with water-balloon scraps and the whole space rattled with scooters. The clouds had advanced throughout the sky, and had enough gray mixed in their billows to generate little stretches of moodiness on the walk down Broadway. There was a chilled bottle of white wine by the corner of the playground, behind the stack of pizza boxes and the streamer-wrapped benches, a loosely bounded party. The birthday guests bounced sturdy jumbo balloons on rubber-band tethers and warred with Silly String till the pavement was a ’90s graphic backdrop.

Downtown, in dappled tree shade, it raised blinding spots from the top of SUV. Conditions kept subtly shifting: light and shade, warmth and coolness, gray and white. The edges of the clouds were now indistinct, now distinct. One could walk in it for blocks, looping out of the everyday pattern.

A pale scrap of a butterfly, with black-tipped wings, bobbed out over the sidewalk and into a fenced-off bed of weeds. Cornering out of the shade of Broadway into Houston was like stepping into a sluggish river and beginning to wade upstream. But the struggle passed. Midday approached and the sky showed brown around the edges, but it was still comfortable up on the roof. Down on the streets at lunchtime, the shade continued to offer refuge.

Two games of frisbee were going on in the open schoolyard, and a boy in an Eli Manning jersey was place-kicking a football off a tee into the fence. There was humidity on the air, but still it was cool. After the playground and a long, sunny uphill, hot vapor was rising through the vent holes in the crash helmet.

Groups had formed discussion circles on the edge of the artificial grove at Lincoln Center; one participant, in a surfeit of abandon, was stretched out prone on the hard pavement. The western sky at dinnertime had one swath of tiny clouds in it, strewn like barely cracked peppercorns. The sun had declined enough now that the two-year-old could no longer object to it shining in his face at the table, though if he fidgeted far enough back in his chair, he could play with his silhouette and complain or marvel that it had no eyes.",4

Some gray gathered over Lower Manhattan, then — were there wet spots on the fire escape? If there were, they were gone soon enough, the whole interlude merely a reminder not to take this for granted. It would take more than that to ruin the day. It would take knives falling from the heavens. Now there was nothing in the sky but firm, well-spaced cumulus clouds. The downtown skyline shone. Uptown, the breeze yanked and shook shirttails, hemlines, pants cuffs. It flipped a necktie. Late sun passed right through banks of windows, bounced off other banks of windows. A concrete facade lit up like a lampshade.

Was it getting brighter? Someone’s mirrored shades, approaching up the street, looked suddenly agleam. Downtown, a fresh wind was blowing down the subway steps. The puddle around the blocked drain on the landing, days old now, had dwindled by maybe half. There were white shoe prints in the black silt layer at the bottom. A cyclist pulled out into the bike lane on Lafayette without looking, forcing an oncoming rider on a Citi Bike to swerve and exclaim. The air felt nice on bare arms, in short sleeves. One’s own skin was skin, after all, with live nerves in it, something more than a thermoregulating membrane or a layer of waterproofing. By afternoon, the sun was out and shining down. Different cloud types overlayered one another, and warm eddies chased after cool ones. People played music out their car windows at a sociopathically solipsistic volume, the beats forcing their way through the crowded sidewalks, carrying around the corner and up the block. The dining hubbub at open-air tables reached restaurant-interior levels. During the walk home, the colors in the west seemed unusually dull and ugly, gray and a bleached dead off-yellow. From the apartment window, though, the tinted monochrome clouds had something going on with them after all, a photographic-plate quality, a bright amber-white scribble along the top of an undulating row of connected dark gray puffs, with more of that hot white coming up on their lower edge. Subtly, the white burned into the gray, veining it and then shredding it, and an orange light started burning up from below. Even as this developed, the sky a few handspans higher up remained pure indifferent daytime blue, with a milk-white contrail stretching fat and persistent across it and white cirrus above that, a swath of some other sky altogether. Between the high and the low a gray veil darkened into view, like the smoke of something dirty burning. Then the sun got into the gray and raised bright ripples on it, while the lower clouds darkened to inky cutouts. The smoky veil turned brilliant pink. Below it, along the horizon, ran a whole field of fine parallel lines of magenta and orange, with still some sky-blue lines running among them. Abruptly, the veil went dark again. Hot-coal reds showed behind it, and the stripes on the sky were now pink and purple. Then the brightness was gone, yet in the dull afterlight, the blankly silhouetted clouds were three-dimensional again, shaded and textured by a barely luminous brown.",5

Another boom followed, sounding very specifically overhead. The street-side windows were white with rain. A roll and a crash; a roll that turned into a crash. Ten minutes went by, fifteen. The booming abated and the rain became an ordinary steady rain. The sky stayed dark, and it was noticeably cooler.

Later, he would experimentally let go of a swing at the top of its arc, to wrap up the day with a fat lip. Excessive possibilities. A small tree under the big trees caught its own portion of sunlight. The clouds had abandoned the sky. Even waiting indoors for takeout was too much. Better to take a slow walk around the next two blocks. A cool wind eased its way up the avenue. Everyone’s hair looked fantastic, alive with subtle textures and shadings. The bricks looked good; the stains and grime on the bricks looked good. The bronze-toned facade of the old OTB parlor, now given over to yoga and herbs, gleamed richly.

The party balloons, herded down Amsterdam, tugged at their ribbons without getting rambunctious. In the midst of the two-year-old’s nap, the doorbell announced the upstairs neighbor, armed with a brand-new plastic lightsaber. John Williams music thumped out of the piano to welcome him. It took a long time in the imperfectly dimmed bedroom to dispel the excitement. After the rest of the nap, after pizza and ice cream cake upstairs and down, the two-year-old found himself out on the plaza in possession of a stout water gun, his t-shirt soaked through. The older children blasted each other’s face paint into smears and drips. The two-year-old assaulted the plantings for a while, then assumed a tactical stance behind a railing. Certain children directed fire toward a pigeon, before the last of the water ran out and the militia disbanded. Out on Amsterdam again, a ladybug flashed by, a fleck of opaque amber, and landed audibly on the tinted window of the cleaner’s.

The elementary school was closed for the day and the prospect of getting the preschooler off to preschool with the first-grader in tow seemed if not impossible at least pointless, or too difficult. Things stalled out, the breakfasts not quite finished, the clothes pulled out but not yet replacing the pajamas. To turn the kettle back on and follow up the first cup of tea would amount to surrender. Weren’t the showers almost past? A radar map showed them going by, but time was going by too. The children made it down the elevator and a step or two out the door, at which point it became clear that further progress would require going back up to fetch a brace of umbrellas. The going-back-up part happened, anyway. Across the avenue, a worker swept water off the open slab of the new tower’s top floor. Each stroke sent a sold-looking mass of water over the edge, where it blew south and broke into droplets and vanished within the first five stories of the drop. The rain was over, but the dripping carried on heavily. Water splashed down through the grate onto the subway tracks. The landing on the stairs up out of the station downtown was sheeted with water, held by a clogged drain. And then, in the time it took to eat a long lunch, the story changed utterly. A brightening outside the restaurant windows revealed itself to be a hazeless sky with pristine white clouds sailing across it on a drying breeze. The sky over Houston Street was vast and open. The moon was ascending, its curve tilted just a little away from straight up. Garbage was coming unstuck from the pavement, matchstick and bottle cap separating themselves from the ground with a sharp slice of shadow. Putting on sunscreen in the gray morning had felt like superstition, now justified. A line of literary aficionados stretched around the corner and down the block from the bookstore. On Broadway, the building facades framed a space of immense luminous white volumes, shaded with gray, on a scale that made the streetscape look like an assemblage of paper cutouts.

The two-year-old was in a dangerous frenzy in the grocery aisles. Taken to the plaza outside the apartment to burn it off, he sent a toy car pinwheeling over the bricks again and again, with some indistinguishable combination of enthusiasm and malice. At naptime, music — a PA system — carried over from who knows where and up 27 stories. Out on the street again, more music blasted from a passing car. Men at the street fair were taking the opportunity to walk around bare-chested, with their shirts in their hands. The playground was dappled and just short of delirium. A preschool classmate grabbed the two-year-old and went one way; a fellow first-grader grabbed the six-year-old and went the other way. The younger boys made a foray to the shady threshold of the women’s restroom, then decided to go play on the slides. The older ones settled into a sort of lopsided kickball game with a tennis ball. A heavy ball slammed into the far side of the chain link head-high; a sparrow came diving by at shoulder level; a little remote-controlled helicopter shot by at groin altitude, with a harsh insectoid chatter, and crashed into the near side of the fence. The tennis-kickball went rolling the wrong way and, with the shocking precision of dumb fate, intercepted the front end of a distant and perpendicularly moving scooter, stopping it dead, pitching the rider over the handlebars. The two-year-old got ahold of the ball and threw it away down the ramp to the school, where it went through a fence and out of reach.

After every crosswalk, the two-year-old went running ahead, taking the full available liberty from curb to curb. A passerby’s eyeshadow glittered; the cellophane on a bouquet was momentarily blinding. Clothes and the bodies under the clothes moved with ease, relaxed or dapper, all the lightness and bareness permitted rather than required. The breeze flowed through flowing fabric, as intended. Outside the hotdog storefront, a spritz of air-conditioner mist drifted down. Why not open a window, open all the windows? The afternoon playground as half in shadow, but the two-year-old was as indifferent to sun or shade as he was to whether he had chased his borrowed basketball into the middle of some older kids’ real basketball game. The demands of thirst and of heavy squirt guns meet in a standoff at one of the concrete drinking fountains. Children with foam-dart arsenals were forming up into militias by the tall end of the climber, arranging and debating and occasionally even playing war games. When no one was looking and his brother was arguing about a game of catch, the two-year-old separated his helmet from his parked scooter and began zooming around bareheaded. A woman emerged from the open front of the brand-new wine bar to bring a container of water to her dog, waiting at the hydrant outside.

So much day, when checked against the clock on the mobile phone — enough to relax and roll over and be woken up an hour later by a child, once everyone had overslept for real. By the end of the school drop-offs, the two-year-old had made up for the lost time, bombing down the wide gradual downhill on his scooter so fast that the parental scooter-minding shuffle-jog gave way to a real trot, past Japanese maples saturated with wine-red. The security guard at the co-op complex turned his head to the sunshine, peeled off his cap, and ran a hand over his face. A sparrow splashed in the chemically turquoise-tinted waters of the top tier of the fountain. The toddler, returning from school, could not get enough of scootering, back and forth across the sunny plaza, ignoring his demonstrated knowledge of the brake in favor of crashing into a wall or the footing of a railing. Sweat matted his hair when the helmet came off. The white-brick condo tower borrowed some blue from the sky. A harmless approximation of summer, summer without the suffering.

It was easy to be out in the street, in sun or shade, either way. The iced coffee dispenser was out of order, and then someone thumped it and the iced coffee flowed again. Two cups, why not. In the early evening, a dozen or more pigeons flashed together in the sky over the 72nd Street subway control house.

The older child, using the playground restroom, had to move his hands back and forth between the cold-only tap and the hot-air dryer. The afternoon was dark and light and dark, cold and hot and cold.

He pressed on, and the drops fell harder and harder till with a block to go, after a wind-lashed street-corner colloquy, he agreed to give up. The way back was over sheets of water and through blowing blasts of rain, past figures huddled in the scant shelter of a doorway or awning, all the while facing a clear blue sky down the avenue.

Jackets were coming off and being draped over arms. The glare began to hurt a little, despite the leaves having popped out. Puddles dwindled; now the clouds were like fish scales coming away under the knife. By early evening, the suffocating air had become simply soft and enveloping. “This day is just a hundred percent perfect,” a young woman said, languidly and inaccurately, as she drifted down Prince Street. That moment of the day may have been. But there were the moments before it, and those that followed: stepping out into the night to hear rain just starting to patter on the trash bags. It was just enough of a shower to make a waiting taxi irresistible — and enough of one to destroy Google Maps’ prediction that the taxi would be faster than a train to Brooklyn.

The rain was light, at the moment, and the first-grader agreed he’d rather walk quickly through it without an umbrella than slowly with an umbrella. A steady file of parents and children arrived late, their morning routines in damp disarray. By late morning the rain was no longer light; it spilled through the scaffold outside the apartment lobby before a hood could be raised against it. Tiny choppy wavelets blew across a street puddle. A woman wrestled with an inside-out golf umbrella, which probably served her right. Rain was splatting down into the subway tracks where the sunbeams had been falling days before. Water drained from the roof of a UPS truck and fountained from an outlet midway down its rear corner. Cars and trucks and taxis were gunning their engines or forcing their way through crosswalks, as if they were the ones who weren’t waterproof, as if the cold wind were hurting steel and glass. A delivery truck, a bottled-drinking-water delivery truck, threw itself forward to block the box and the crosswalk together. The rain accumulated and accumulated, grand in its relentlessness. The landing of the subway stairs was flooded; the crosswalks were flooded. Around Times Square, in the late afternoon, a few fans still huddled outside a stage door. Umbrellas clustered outside a ramen shop by 10th Avenue, where the umbrella-holders waited for the CLOSED sign to flip to OPEN at 5. In the time it took to get through two shared deep bowls of soup, the two better-grade bodega umbrellas, hooked side by side over the edge of an umbrella bucket, had come unhooked and separated. After much rummaging, the second turned up, completely sodden, at the bottom of the other umbrella bucket. Out in the unending downpour, the umbrella handle thrummed with the vibrations of the rainfall. The avenue was gridlocked, the traffic more maddened than before. Nothing made sense but the rain. It was pouring rain down inside the 50th Street station, on the platform. The ground and street above were a discredited notion. Sneakers were saturated, pants soggy to the knee.

Didn’t he want to go faster? He supposed he did. The flags hissed as the stirring wind made them undulate back on themselves. The two-year-old pulled up beside two other children, scooters parked and chain-link shadows patterning their helmets, to watch another child practice tee ball. Then he took off across the paved yard, circling unerringly for the one truly substantial pool among the various scattered puddles. He splashed through it, leaving wet tire tracks and a single repeating footprint after he emerged. Another small child was stomping in the puddles, and they came to an agreement on a coordinated assault on a lesser puddle, the shoe soles of the infantry and scooter wheels of the cavalry scattering the water up and out, over and over, into a ragged smear. The playground was filling up — there were near-collisions now, and the occasional actual collision — but every time the yard seemed about to get warm, more and bigger clouds would cover the sun again, and the chill would deepen.

A man walked by with his hands thrust in the high pockets of his pea coat, the posture even more pinched and uncomfortable-looking than hands-in-pea-coat usually is.

The glow had also pulled the adult further out of grogginess than usual, into competence: No. Lie down. No. Go back to sleep. Now. By the time everyone woke up again, the pale blur of fresh, accumulating snow had changed over to something else, wet and grotesque. Ice was building up on the windows; sheets of ice were bursting loose and coming flipping down through the air, end over end, dozens of fragments plunging past like titanic snowflakes: the size of dollar bills, sheets of paper, shoebox lids. A broken triangle as big as the top of a coffee table. Meteorological-architectural horrors. The drizzle outside was imperceptible if you had your back to it, harsh if you turned to face it. Lakes of loose slush swelled behind dams of firmer slush. The trees were glazed and stubby icicles dangled from a restaurant’s festive outdoor light bulb strands. Strollers wallowed or jammed to a halt. Crossing the median of West End with one required a portage. The basic urban assumption, that things would ultimately be passable, was null. The trains were by all accounts hopeless. The toddler, in his lurching stroller ride home, wanted nothing more than to get his rubber boots on and get back out, at once. So: “So fun!” The little boots tramped an excited loop in the snow in the building garden. By now the drizzle had turned into a light rain, darkening the child’s coat. Apocalyptic ice fragments were still plummeting and shattering with each new gust of wind, but up close they were paper-thin, harmless.

Snow bounced on the canopy of the stroller as it bumped through the slush, the flakes finding each other and gathering into bigger and bigger wads. The chains on bus wheels left slashes across their tire tracks. Cold wetness was seeping into one of the ordinary boots from somewhere; the rubber-bottomed ones would have to come out of storage.

The humans were as unsteady as the storm was steady. A black SUV swung violently toward one crosswalk to make a U-turn, then bore down on pedestrians in another one, indifferent to any possible limits on its stopping power.

There was a little snowdrift in the side of the vestibule, and snow blew deep into the lobby. Later, just before bedtime, the outside looked calm. Out in it, one last time, it was hard to tell if the intermittently visible snow was falling or just blowing. Smoke-like bursts of it were being kicked up by the wind in all directions.

The cold wind from the river, coming along 7oth Street, made a surprise push across West End and nearly up to Amsterdam, but it wasn’t quite cold enough to hurt. And the light was all over the place. At Columbus Circle, the sun was being preceded over the buildings by a blurry greater circle of the sun’s influence, while sharp rays came zigzagging in sideways from below. On Broadway, starlings and the multidirectional shadows of starlings hopped and fluttered.",4

Instead, the sky went from an ambiguous, featureless blue-gray to a featureless gray, then on to the mottled gray of indisputable cloud cover. Dampness hovered at sidewalk level, a clammy invisible fog. The CNN sign over Columbus Circle said it was 47 degrees, but no one seemed to be enjoying it. In the office, it was time to turn the desk lamp back on again, against the gloom. Only after dark, when hopes were lowered and the floating moisture softened the lights all around, did it become anything like pleasant.",1

Finally it cleared the shadow of its own construction, and sunlight hit the safety-orange of its upper surface. It swung in, did its work, and swung out again, over and down into the shade. Two hours later, it was still going, its curving bottom lips pursed against yellow-white where the yellow-pink had been. The afternoon light downtown was yellow too. Steam blew gently eastward. Down in the shadows, in the still, grimy space between buildings, a young red-tailed hawk perched on a cold metal railing, waiting to kill rats.",3

The image of the sun itself flashed orange-red off the windows of New Jersey, and then illumination flooded their faces, sending warm tones reflecting back east off the surface of the river. The buildings downstream brightened into blocks of creamy light and dusty-blue shadow. Out on Broadway, the upper panels of a breakfast cart’s shade umbrella flared silver like a photographer’s umbrella reflector. Downtown, a woman hurried up the street, glancing at a communication device, with her long puffy coat unzipped and flapping behind her. Two men, one after another, were dressed for indoors, but with plaid mufflers wrapped around their necks. The public was divided on the question of whether to have kept their coats and shed their bundling-up accessories, or to have kept the accessories and shed the coats. Even after 5 o’clock, a glow remained in the sky, and the breeze was merely bracing.",4

The expanse of sky over the Port Washington line was cloud-covered, but with intimations of something less grim: bits of blue glimmered to the north of the train; patches of brightness glowed through to the south. By the time the dim sum hall had filled up, as the early brunch hour moved toward lunch, full sunshine lay over Flushing. Gulls flapped or glided over the train platform, against a clear sky. Midday in Manhattan was almost warm in the sun, or at least mild, and only a little chilly in the shade. It didn’t matter where the kindergartner’s knit gloves had gotten to, let alone the insulated mittens. He thrust in hands in his coat pockets and was fine. Other people thrust their hands in their coat pockets. A branch of a discarded Christmas tree moved a little in the breeze by the curb. Light worked its way around to find red furniture on a north-facing balcony. Incinerator smoke blended with a sooty purple haze on the uptown skyline. Down to the south and west, a few late clouds arrived, just enough and just in time to make glittering streaks around the descending sun.",4

Daylight did come, long enough to shine glassily on the Hudson and illuminate a passing airplane. Then the shroud: gray overhead, yellow downtown, and one briefly surviving band of blue uptown. At half past noon, the light was already failing, into an afternoon of edgeless clouds, directionless dim light, seeping chill. Sometime in after evening, rain must have fallen; on the way to the drugstore, the dark pavement was covered with wet grime. A rat crossed the sidewalk, from gutter to rubble pit.

A cold headwind gathered strength with each step away from home. Sparrows hopped around the A-C/B-D platform at Columbus Circle, two levels down from the out-of-doors. A no-passengers train, interior darkened, rolled through the station. Down by Lafayette Street, around a corner, people surrounded a young woman who lay huddled on a sheet of cardboard. One of them bent over her solicitously and rearranged some scattered matchbooks, a tableau of fake suffering, as another stepped back with a camera. Now and then the wind carried tiny flecks of drizzle, so small they barely registered as wet, but as pinpricks of a colder cold. In the fading afternoon, someone in the next apartment building was shooting flash photographs in a room with the lights off — a nagging, intermittent stimulus to the peripheral vision, which was otherwise ready to quit for the day.",0

Vague promises of snow produced instead a cold, needly rain, with a few flakes blown in for not-very-interesting contrast. Discarded things stuck to the wet pavement in the evening: kinked twine, plastic sheeting, a crumpled something that was either an elbow-length glove or an unwanted umbrella sheath.

Going outside wasn’t a chore; neither was going back inside. The clouds were mostly proportionate to the sun. There was one stray big one that an excitable child could believe might have a bit of rain in it. By the time the excitable child made it into the 72nd Street subway control house — the newer one, on the uptown side of the street — the cloud had gone away, without having cast enough shade to ease the heat under the glass roof.

The lowering sun, which had shone straight into the living room in the weeks around the solstice and the Manhattanhenges, now dropped behind the megalith of the nearest apartment tower, its declination heading toward autumn. But its light hit the floors above us, bounced back to the windows of the obstructing building, and came in again on the second bounce.",1
