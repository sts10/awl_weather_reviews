1. Read in (either locally or from Githuc as I think I did with the other projects) this csv file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sts10/awl_alt_scraper/master/csv/archive1.csv
2. filter for URLs containing "weather-review"
3. Optional: Create new CSV by scraping just these weather review posts for (a) lead image, (b) headline (and possible location + date as separate variables), (c) number of stars (if any), and (d) the text of the review itself, just in case we want to use it later. 
4. Create website to display the images filled in 100% width and, if I can, infinite scroll, only showing date and rating and maybe location on hover. Click to go to post?
